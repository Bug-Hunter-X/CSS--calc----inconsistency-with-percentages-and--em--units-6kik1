Several solutions exist to address this issue:

**1. Explicit Parent Width:**

The most straightforward solution is to set the width of the parent container explicitly. This provides a consistent reference for the `calc()` function to use. 

```css
.parent {
  width: 800px; /* Or any other fixed width */
}

.container {
  width: calc(50% - 2em);
}
```

**2. Alternative Approach (Avoiding calc):**

Instead of using `calc()`, consider using alternative techniques that avoid the mixture of percentage and `em` units, such as flexbox or grid layout, or directly defining the pixel values based on your needs.

**3. Unit Consistency:**

Ensure the units are consistent before applying the `calc()` operation. Convert `em` values to `px` or `%` depending on what best suits your need, and perform the operation between those consistent units.

Choose the solution that best fits the overall design and context of your project.  Explicitly setting the parent's width is often the easiest and most reliable solution.
